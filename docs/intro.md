# Lista Recurring Events

**Powerful recurring events for WordPress with Bricks Builder & Elementor integration.**

Lista Recurring Events transforms your WordPress site into a full-featured event management platform. Create events once and let the plugin automatically calculate and display all future occurrences—no need to create multiple posts for repeating events.

![Plugin Overview](/img/lista-recurring-events-ui-calendar.webp)

## Key Features

- **Smart Recurrence Calculation** — Define patterns once; occurrences are calculated dynamically
- **Multiple Recurrence Patterns** — Daily, Weekly, Monthly (by weekday or date), Yearly, and Custom dates
- **Bricks Builder Integration** — Custom query loop, dynamic data tags, and filter elements
- **Elementor Integration** — Loop widget, dynamic tags, and filter widgets
- **Interactive Calendar** — Beautiful FullCalendar integration with the `[lre_calendar]` shortcode
- **Add to Calendar** — Let visitors save events to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, and more
- **Field Overrides** — Set different values (title, image, location) for specific occurrences
- **Multi-Post Type Support** — Configure multiple custom post types as event types
- **Performance Optimized** — Intelligent caching prevents redundant calculations

## How It Works

Traditional event plugins require you to create a separate post for each occurrence of a repeating event. Lista Recurring Events takes a different approach:

1. **One Post Per Event** — Create a single event post with your content
2. **Set the Pattern** — Configure how often the event repeats
3. **Automatic Calculation** — The plugin calculates all future occurrences on-the-fly
4. **Dynamic Display** — Show upcoming dates using dynamic tags, shortcodes, or query loops

This approach keeps your database clean, makes updates simple (change once, update everywhere), and provides flexibility for complex scheduling needs.

## Requirements

| WordPress | 6.8 or higher |
